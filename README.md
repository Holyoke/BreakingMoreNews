# Hug's Away Screen
~~As a fan of Hug68's stream on Twitch, I've been bothered by his away screen's time - it was just a image, so the time was only right once a day(in terms of military time).~~ This is an updated take on http://www.breakyourownnews.com/, and this project in particular is to address an away screen.
